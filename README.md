## Cookie Monster

**Cookie Monster** is an addon you can load into Cookie Clicker, that offers a wide range of tools and statistics to enhance the game. **It is not a cheat interface** – although it does offer helpers for golden cookies and such, everything can be toggled off at will to only leave how much information you want.
The mod helps you to *whichever* degree you want, if you only need some help shortening long numbers, it does that. If you need to be accompanied by hand to pick the best buildings to buy, it does that, but **everything is an option**.

### Current version
The `gh-pages` branch hosts the latest version intended for general users. All development and pull requests should target the `dev` branch.

### What it does

At its core, Cookie Monster computes an index for both buildings and upgrades: the **Payback Period (PP)**. This indicates how much a building is worth by using the following formula: 
```
max(cost - cookies in bank, 0)/cps + cost/Δ cps
```

Cookie Monster also indicates the time left before being able to buy an upgrade or building, and takes it into consideration. It will take *everything* in consideration, meaning if buying a building also unlocks an achievement which boosts your income, which unlocks an achievement, it will know and highlight that building's value.

This index is computed for buildings and upgrades. If the relevant option is enabled, it will color-code each of them based on their value:

* Light Blue: (upgrades) This item has a better PP than the best building to buy
* Green: This building has the best PP
* Yellow: This building is within the top 10 of best PP's
* Orange: This building is within the top 20 of best PP's
* Red: This building is within the top 30 of best PP's
* Purple: This building is worse than the top 10 of best PP's
* Gray: This item does not have a PP, often this means that there is no change to CPS

Note: For this index, **lower is better**, meaning a building with a PP of 1 is more interesting than one with a PP of 3.

## Using

### Bookmarklet

Copy this code and save it as a bookmark. Paste it in the URL section. To activate, click the bookmark when the game's open.

```javascript
javascript: (function () {
	Game.LoadMod('https://aktanusa.github.io/CookieMonster/CookieMonster.js');
}());
```

If (for some reason) the above doesn't work, trying pasting everything after the <code>javascript:</code> bit into your browser's console.

### Userscript

If you'd rather use the addon as a [userscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript) to automatically load _Cookie Monster_ every time the original game loads, install the `CookieMonster.user.js` file. You can do this by clicking on the file in the file-list and clicking "raw".

**Note that to avoid conflicts Cookie Monster should ideally be loaded after any other content mods have been loaded**
